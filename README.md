# UFOs
JavaScript
In this module, I took UFO sightings data that includes, date, location, and the shape of the UFO. I arranged the data with JavaScript to filter through sightings based on certain criteria. I created a webpage using HTML that displays the data and allows the user to use the filters I created.
